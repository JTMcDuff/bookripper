* BookRipper *
** A Resource for Gamer Geeks **

BookRipper converts pdf documents into useful programmatic format for developers. I'm making it to assist with my other gaming projects. Initially, I plan to focus on tables in pdfs and converting into javascript objects. We will see where it goes from there. This grew out of my other work on the Godbound Generator.

** TODO **
1. Add Technologies and other sections to README.
2. Work up first file to process existing objects for formatting purposes.
3. Brainstorm more TODOs!
